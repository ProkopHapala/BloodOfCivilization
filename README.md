# BloodOfCivilization

A minimalistic strategy game with inted to simulate economy of houman civilization. 
It takes concepts from several other games, but ties to make it more elegant and more apt. 
Unlike in case of other games, the intend here is not as much to be funny, but also to express some simplified models economy at high level of abstraction.
I also tries to simulat autonomous behaviour of economic units, and avoid micro management.

Beside the economy side there should be also combat but at high level of abstraction without micro-management.

### Inspirations:

* Civilization -
* Transport Tycoon
* Hearts Of Iron
* Totalwar ( Strategic map part )
